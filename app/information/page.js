            <h2 className="text-2xl md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl font-semibold mb-2 md:mb-4">Our story</h2>
            <div className="grid gap-2 md:gap-3 font-medium text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-2xl mb-20">
                <p>The origins of Avantgarde trace back to a serendipitous encounter in the vibrant streets of Copenhagen. In 2010, our founder, Alexander JÃ¸rgensen, a passionate architect with a keen eye for modern design, stumbled upon a small, quaint boutique showcasing a collection of avant-garde chairs from various designers. The elegance and diversity of the designs struck a chord with Alexander, igniting a vision for a new kind of furniture store.</p>
                <p>Inspired by the Danish principles of functionality and aesthetic beauty, Alexander set out to create a brand that would revolutionize contemporary furniture retail. He envisioned a place where each chair was not only a functional object but also a work of art, reflecting the latest trends in design while maintaining unparalleled comfort and durability.</p>
                <p>In 2012, Avantgarde was born in a small studio in the heart of Copenhagen. Alexander partnered with a network of innovative designers from around the world who shared his passion for innovation and quality. They began curating a collection of unique, contemporary chairs that combined cutting-edge design with the finest craftsmanship.</p>
