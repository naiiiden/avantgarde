                <h2>Our story</h2>
                <p>
                    The origins of Avantgarde trace back to a serendipitous encounter in the vibrant streets of Copenhagen. In 2010, our founder, Alexander JÃ¸rgensen, a passionate architect with a keen eye for modern design, stumbled upon a small, quaint boutique showcasing a collection of avant-garde chairs from various designers. The elegance and diversity of the designs struck a chord with Alexander, igniting a vision for a new kind of furniture store.
                    Inspired by the Danish principles of functionality and aesthetic beauty, Alexander set out to create a brand that would revolutionize contemporary furniture retail. He envisioned a place where each chair was not only a functional object but also a work of art, reflecting the latest trends in design while maintaining unparalleled comfort and durability.
                    In 2012, Avantgarde was born in a small studio in the heart of Copenhagen. Alexander partnered with a network of innovative designers from around the world who shared his passion for innovation and quality. They began curating a collection of unique, contemporary chairs that combined cutting-edge design with the finest craftsmanship.
